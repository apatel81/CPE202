"""Rather than dividing the work and combining our code, we decided to work 
on the project after our classes on Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday after 
because we have the exact same schedule. Also, we used Lab time to work on the
project as well. Overall, it was a collaborative effort to create and test 
functions. As each function was made, we would test the function to ensure that
it worked as desired before preceding onward."""
